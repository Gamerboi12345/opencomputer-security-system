# opensecurity-scp-security-system

<a href="https://oc.cil.li/topic/994-security-system-for-opensecurity">This was built off of DustPuppy's system here</a>

This security system was built for the <a href="https://www.technicpack.net/modpack/site-91.1622979">Site 91</a> modpack official server, but I made it public so others could enjoy it.
I built it off of DustPuppy's system from the Open Computers official website (link above), but it is in no way the same as what it originally was.

In total: this is what this new system supports:

<ol>
  <li>Two different card database types: One that works on normal open os, and a ported version for MineOS (way faster and pretty).</li>
  <li>Settings for Staff, GOI, MTF, Level, Armory Level, Department, Blocked, Intercom, and Security</li>
  <li>Two door control types: One is for a single door and supports normal redstone, rolldoor, bundled redstone, and doorcontrol, and a Multidoor, that can control any amount of doors from a single computer</li>
  <li>An automatic setup command that works by running a pastebin command (will be down below)</li>
  <li>Auto Update system! (you have to send a network message through another computer to update all doors. Prolly not necessary) update size has reached beyond limit to be able to send the update through the modem. You will have to do this manually with the autoinstaller autoupdate function, and manually with openos database and server. Mineos system has an update button in app store.</li>
  <li>Easy setting edits: Autoinstaller has functions to let you edit, add, or remove doors as well as wipe all files and update the computer!</li>
</ol>

Instructions on what I gotta check out and maybe add

Definitely Servertine (this):
2. DoorSetup allow runtime door editing on currently running doors. (maybe an added perk of choosing door systems through naming multidoors)
5. SectorControl module for Servertine (an optional manual changing utility)
7. Possible KeyPad, RFID Reader, and Biometric Reader.
8. Database remote control module
10. Open Linking and User ID string values

Debug and Test
RFID Reader
Linking

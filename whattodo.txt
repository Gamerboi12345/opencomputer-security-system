Instructions on what I gotta check out and maybe add

Definitely Servertine (this):
2. DoorSetup allow runtime door editing on currently running doors. (maybe an added perk of choosing door systems through naming multidoors)
5. SectorControl module for Servertine (an optional manual changing utility)
7. Possible KeyPad, RFID Reader, and Biometric Reader.
8. Database remote control module
10. Open Linking and User ID string values

Debug and Test
RFID Reader
Linking

done
groups (-int) get dropdown rather than int changer with +- (DONE)
Text Box for level in security module (no +- buttons alone, quick change) (DONE)
CryptKey ALL THE FEATURES I CAN to prevent security holes (DONE)
Save changes done on DoorSetup to prevent data loss upon leaving the module (DONE)
Make SectorControl utilize runtime changes (3 wires per sector: 1 to turn off lockdown, another to enable, and another to lock open) (DONE)


DO:
